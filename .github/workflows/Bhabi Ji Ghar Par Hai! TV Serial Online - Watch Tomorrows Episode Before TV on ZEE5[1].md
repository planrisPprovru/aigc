## Best Scenes and Dialogues from Episodes 101 to 150

1. Vibhuti's detective agency: In episode 101, Vibhuti decides to open a detective agency and names it "Vibhuti Narayan Mishra Detective Agency". He hires Angoori as his assistant and gives her a code name "Angoori Bond". He also makes a fake ID card for her and tells her to keep it secret. He then takes up various cases, such as finding a missing dog, catching a cheating husband and solving a murder mystery. However, he ends up messing up every case and getting into trouble. The scenes where Vibhuti and Angoori disguise themselves as different characters and try to solve the cases are hilarious. Some of the dialogues from this track are:
    - Vibhuti: Angoori ji, aapko pata hai detective kya hota hai? (Angoori ji, do you know what a detective is?)
    - Angoori: Nahi. (No.)
    - Vibhuti: Detective woh hota hai jo kisi ki peeth peeche uski harkatein dekhta hai. (A detective is someone who watches someone's actions behind their back.)
    - Angoori: Toh aap bhi toh meri peeth peeche meri harkatein dekhte hain. (But you also watch my actions behind my back.)
    - Vibhuti: Haan, lekin main detective hoon. Aapki harkatein dekhne ka mera adhikaar hai. (Yes, but I am a detective. I have the right to watch your actions.)
    - Angoori: Toh Tiwari ji ka kya? (What about Tiwari ji?)
    - Vibhuti: Tiwari ji ka kuch nahi. Woh toh bas aapki pati hain. (Tiwari ji has nothing. He is just your husband.)
2. Tiwari's ghost possession: In episode 110, Tiwari gets possessed by a ghost named Bhootnath, who claims to be his ancestor. He starts behaving strangely and scares everyone in the colony. He also starts flirting with Anita and insults Vibhuti. Vibhuti tries to get rid of the ghost by consulting a tantrik, but fails. The scenes where Tiwari acts like a ghost and makes funny noises and faces are very amusing. Some of the dialogues from this track are:
    - Tiwari: Anita bhabhi, main aapka deewana hoon. Aap mujhe bahut pasand hain. (Anita bhabhi, I am crazy about you. I like you very much.)
    - Anita: Tiwari ji, yeh aap kya keh rahe hain? Aap toh Angoori bhabhi se pyaar karte hain. (Tiwari ji, what are you saying? You love Angoori bhabhi.)
    - Tiwari: Angoori bhabhi kaun? Main toh Bhootnath hoon. Main aapke saath rehna chahta hoon. (Who is Angoori bhabhi? I am Bhootnath. I want to live with you.)
    - Anita: Bhootnath? Yeh koi naam hai? Aap pagal ho gaye hain kya? (Bhootnath? Is that a name? Have you gone mad?)
    - Tiwari: Pagal nahi, premi hoon main. Aap mujhe apna lo na bhabhi. (Not mad, lover I am. Accept me as yours bhabhi.)
    - Anita: Vibhu! Vibhu! Bachao! (Vibhu! Vibhu! Help!)
